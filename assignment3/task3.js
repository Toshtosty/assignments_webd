/*
Task 3: Convert Promises to Async/Await
Further refactor the code to use async/await syntax.


Write an async function that sequentially:


Simulates downloading data.


Simulates writing data to a file.


Simulates uploading the file to a new URL.


Use async/await to handle the asynchronous operations in a cleaner and more readable way.

Additional Notes:
Actual network or file system operations are not required.


Use setTimeout or a similar mechanism to simulate delays and asynchronous behavior.


Add console logs to indicate the start and completion of each simulated step.
